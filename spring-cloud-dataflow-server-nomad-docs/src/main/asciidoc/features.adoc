The Data Flow Server for Nomad includes the following highlighted features.
--

== Support for Maven and Docker resources

Nomad supports both https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/java.html[Java]
and https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/docker.html[Docker]
drivers that the Data Flow server can utilise to support apps registered as
Maven and Docker resources.

For example, both the below app registrations (via the Data Flow Shell) are valid and supported:

```
dataflow:>app register --name http-mvn --type source --uri maven://org.springframework.cloud.stream.app:http-source-rabbit:1.1.0.RELEASE
dataflow:>app import --name http-docker --type source --uri app register --name http --type source --uri docker:springcloudstream/http-source-rabbit:1.1.0.RELEASE
```

See the <<getting-started>> section for examples of deploying both Docker and Maven resource types.

== Docker volume support

Docker volume support was added in Nomad https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#050-november-16-2016[0.5].
which allows the Data Flow Server for Nomad to support defining Docker volumes, both as deployer and app deployment
properties.

NOTE: Volumes defined at deployer level will be added to _all_ deployed apps. This is handy for
common shared folders that should be available to all apps.

Below is an example of volumes defined as a server deployer property:

[source,yaml]
----
spring.cloud.deployer.nomad:
  volumes: /opt/data:/data,/opt/config:/config
----

where volumes are defined as a comma separated list in the form of `host_path:container_path`.

Examples of the deployment property (via the Data Flow Shell) variation of defining volumes and volume mounts below:

[source,console]
----
dataflow:>stream create --name test --definition "time | file"
Created new stream 'timezoney'

dataflow:>stream deploy test --properties "app.file.spring.cloud.deployer.nomad.volumes=/opt/data:/data,/opt/config:/config"
----

See the Nomad Docker https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/docker.html#volumes[volume documentation] for more details.

== Ephemeral disks

The new https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/ephemeral_disk.html[ephemeral_disk]
stanza added in Nomad 0.5 is supported, allowing you to configure an ephemeral disk with app deployment properties.

== App status derived from Consul

The default states for a Nomad https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/index.html[job]
are not really indicative of a healthy application.
For instance an app may appear to be running based on the Nomad Job/Allocation state
but is in fact not healthy as determined by invoking the app's
health endpoint (e.g. `/health`). For a more accurate app status, the Data Flow Server for Nomad can now
include the Consul (if available) health check status fo the registered app's Service.

This feature is implemented using https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-consul/[Spring Cloud Consul].
